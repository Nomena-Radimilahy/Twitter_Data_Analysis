    "\n",
    "ChatGPT, a generative AI system developed by OpenAI, has quickly become one of the most widely adopted online services. Despite significant public interest in ChatGPT, there has been relatively little research on how the public perceives this technology. This project aims to analyze the public perception of ChatGPT on Twitter, specifically focusing on the first three months following its release.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The analysis seeks to address the following research questions:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**RQ1**: How did social media users react to ChatGPT in the first three months after its release?\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**RQ2**: Which aspects of ChatGPT were most frequently discussed on Twitter?\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "To answer these qu stions, the study employs sentiment analysis using the VADER tool and topic modeling  nalys s using BRTopic.\r\n",
